Installing Conda on Oscar

1.  Copy the download link for the Python 2.7 command line installer (not the graphical
     installer!) of Anaconda for Linux via

            https://www.continuum.io/downloads

     Make sure you select the tab on the Continuum downloads page corresponding
     to Linux.

2.  Login to Oscar and navigate to your home directory.  You should be in your home
     directory by default when you ssh into Oscar, but to be certain of this, you can issue

            cd ~

     on the command line.

3.  Download the installer via wget on Oscar.  As an example, this can be done by issuing

            wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh

     on the command line.  Replace the link after 'wget' with the link you have copied to
     ensure you are downloading the most recent version of Anaconda.

4.  Once wget finishes downloading the installation file (Anaconda*.sh), install Anaconda
     with

            bash Anaconda2-4.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh

     where, again, you replace the .sh file with the file you just downloaded.

5.  Proceed through the installation.  When prompted for the install location, e.g.

            Anaconda2 will now be installed into this location:
            /users/YOUR-USERNAME/anaconda2

     press enter to confirm as you need to install Anaconda in your home directory.
     You will also be prompted at the end of the installation process with a message
     asking if you would like to prepend the Anaconda install locaiton to your PATH
     in your bashrc, e.g.

             Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda2 install location
             to PATH in your /users/YOUR-USERNAME/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
             [no] >>

     Type yes for this prompt (note that the default is no).  This will give Anaconda
     precedence above the existing Python distribution installed by default for all users on
     Oscar.

6.  To ensure that the installation and modification of PATH have been successful,
     first issue

            source ~/.bashrc

     which will update your PATH variable for your current Oscar session.  Then issue

            which python

     If this returns "~/anaconda2/bin/python" then Anaconda has been installed successfully.
