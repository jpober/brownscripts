Files in this directory:

Firstpass:
pipe_slurm.sh
	> The top level script for running firstpass jobs (and eppsilon power spectrum) on Oscar. Should be placed in FHD/Observations
	> Requires a file with a list of Obs IDs and a version string.
	> Run using nohup to ensure that it doesn't stop when logging out. It will wait for the firstpass job to finish before running power spectrum and will resubmit incomplete jobs.

eor_firstpass_slurm_job.sh
	> The job script submitted by pipe_slurm. Runs eor_firstpass_versions.
	> Should be placed in FHD/Observation, where pipe_slurm can find it.

eor_firstpass_versions.pro
	> Runs the general_obs task. This is already part of FHD. I've included my own version, which has extra code for running the IDL profiler if desired.

Power Spectrum:
ps_slurm.sh
	> Top level code for running eppsilon on Oscar. Should be put into the eppsilon/ps_wrappers directory.

integrate_slurm_job.sh:
	> Job script for integrating Healpix cubes.

PS_list_slurm_job.sh
	> The job script for running power spectrum.

locate_uvfits_oscar.py
	> A rudimentary script, accessed by pipe_slurm and others, that will return a full path to a uvfits file given an ObsId.
	> Must be included in PYTHONPATH to work.
