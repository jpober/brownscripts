The collection of all scripts that are useful to the eorlive v2 website lives in this dir.


------------------------
generate_beam_image.py

Python script that generates the beam image at /var/beam_images. This path should be pre-generated.
In order to run it as a cron process, first wrap it in a shell script like below

#! /bin/bash
source /opt/pyvenv/eorlive/bin/activate
/home/ubuntu/MWA_Tools/eorlive_v2/scripts/generate_beam_image.py

So it runs within the venv where mwapy is installed. Then add the crobtab entry like below

*/10     *     *     *     *         /home/ubuntu/generate_image.sh



--------------------------
insert_fake_graph_data.sql

Used to insert some bogus data to test the front end charting system.
Not really useful anymore since we have old_eor_obs_data.sql. See below.



---------------------------
old_eor_obs_data.sql

Old eorlive website used Google Fusion Table to host the data for plotting.
This sql script is a result of parsing that legacy data into an insert statement.
Feed this statement into the database and you have yourself the old real data.
The command would look something like this

psql -h localhost -U eor -d eor -f old_eor_obs_data.sql




------------------------------
pull_chart_data.py

This is the python script that gathers all the data for one row of data that we use for making graphs.
Run it in the same manner as generate_beam_image.py script.
