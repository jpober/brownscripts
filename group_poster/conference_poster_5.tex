\begin{abstract}

Following the recombination of hydrogen and release of the cosmic microwave background radiation at redshift $z \sim 1100$, the baryonic matter of the universe consisted mostly of neutral hydrogen and helium. Gradually, small inhomogeneities collapsed and ignited the first luminous structures. Energetic photons emitted from the first stars and quasars reionized the surrounding medium, producing ionized bubbles which grew and merged into the fully ionized intergalactic medium we see today. This \emph{Epoch of Reionization} (EoR) remains a poorly-understood period of the universe's history which offers a wealth of cosmological and astrophysical information.

The Pober lab is part of an international effort to build instruments capable of studying the EoR. The neutral hydrogen (HI) of the EoR emits faintly at a wavelength of 21cm, due to the hyperfine transition. This emission is unique to neutral hydrogen, and is anti-correlated with the ionized (HII) regions that fill the universe through the EoR. CMB constraints and quasar absorption spectra put the EoR as occurring within the redshift range $6 < z < 12$, which means 21cm emissions will redshift to meter scale wavelengths. This is accessible to modern radio interferometers, including the \emph{Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization} (PAPER), the \emph{Murchison Widefield Array} (MWA), and the recently-funded \emph{Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array} (HERA).

%The main focus of the Pober Lab is the direct observation of the 21cm Neutral Hydrogen (HI) emission through the use of radio telescope arrays to detect the signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The 21cm hyperfine spin flip, which is typically a forbidden transition, has a mean lifetime on the order of 100 million years. This time scale, and the abundance of HI in the universe gives us the ability to map the progress of reionization which has the redshift range of 6 $<$ z $<$ 12. To observe the reionization of the HI, we use radio telescope arrays, because the 21cm emission corresponds to 1420 MHz at rest and when received at Earth corresponds to 100-200 MHz due to cosmological redshifting. The Pober Lab contributes to several international radio telescope array collaborations which include the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the newly NSF funded Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).

Eqn. \ref{difftemp}}.
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Differential Brightness Temperature}
\begin{equation}
\label{difftemp}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$
\delta T_{b} = 28mK(1+\delta)x_{HI}\Big(1-\frac{T_{CMB}}{T_{spin}}\Big)\Big(\frac{\sigma_{b}h^2}{0.0223}\Big)\sqrt{\Big(\frac{1+z}{10}\Big)\Big(\frac{0.24}{\sigma_m}\Big)}\Big[ \frac{H(z)/(1+z)}{dv_{||}/dr_{||}}\Big]$}
\end{equation}
The differential brightness temperature describes the complex nature of the neutral hydrogen spin temperature,$T_S$ decoupling from the CMB background temperature $T_{CMB}$, the neutral fraction of Hydrogen, $x_{HI}$, and the mass density contrast, $\delta$.
$\delta T_b$ also describes an important relationship between cosmological and astrophysical parameters, showing that measuring what is seen as a cosmological epoch has astrophysical relevance.

\section*{The Foreground Problem} %[I dont need all of these plots, they're just there to be cut as needed or if necessary to take up more space]
Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds pose a difficult problem when trying to measure the 21cm EoR signal. Relative to galactic foregrounds, the EoR signal is $\sim$ 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the galactic emissions that exist between our observing radio telescope arrays and the highly redshifted 21cm signal. The overlapping sources of power in our observations can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:foregroundsrcs}.


\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
To overcome foreground dominance in our power spectrum analysis we can use a combination of foreground power mitigating techniques as outlined in the following subsections.
%The issue of foreground emission dominance in our power spectrum can be overcome through the mixed use of the following traditional and novel foreground mitigation techniques. \\
\subsubsection*{Foreground Subtraction}
Baseline visibilities are gridded to form an image which are calibrated to a source catalog model. The catalog model contains point sources from surveys which contain the sources' right ascension, declination, and flux in stokes I. The model built from the catalog of sources is additionally convolved with the telescope array's synthesized beam model. The resulting model which has been built can then be subtracted from the observation leaving behind the EoR signal and diffuse emissions.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\label{fig:foresubtract}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/foresub.png}\\
\caption{LST binned visibility of a 30m East-West baseline from the PAPER-64 array. The left plots show a baseline visibility pre- and post subtraction. The right plots show the delay transform of the left plots, demonstrating the foreground power being concentrated within the horizon limit (dotted lines).}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Foreground Avoidance}
\begin{equation}
\label{delaytransform}
\widetilde{V}_b(\tau) = \int dl dm d\nu A(l,m,\nu)I(l,m,\nu)e^{-2\pi i\nu(\tau_g -\tau)}
\end{equation}
Taking the Fourier transform of a baseline visibility (which includes a windowing function $A(l,m,\nu)$ and the specific intensity $I(l,m,\nu)$) over frequency with the geometric group delay offset (eqn. \ref{delaytransform}) results in 
smooth spectrum foregrounds bunching up nearest to the delay of $\tau = 0$. This is because foreground sources have a maximal geometric 
delay associated with a baseline length, $|\vec{b}|$, which is also known as the horizon limit. The EoR signal is unsmooth spectrally (Fig. \ref{fig:delayspace}), 
distinguishing it from foreground sources, and pushing it beyond the horizon limit imposed by the baseline length. Using this information, 
delays below the horizon limit can be filtered giving significant foreground power removal.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/delaytransform.png}\\
\caption{Delay transform visibilities of two different baseline types. Smooth spectral sources moving between delays over time can be seen to remain within the horizon limit (dotted), while unsmooth spectral sources (light blue) extend beyond the horizon limit.

%	MATERIALS AND METHODS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{Simulation}

The particular characteristics of an array can introduce unexpected effects into the data. To detect a signal as weak as the EoR, understanding and mitigating instrumental effects is critical. For this reason, much effort has been put into simulating the full analysis pipeline, from the point and diffuse sources on the sky to the raw visibilities that come out to the power spectrum estimations.

Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) is a purpose-built software framework for analyzing MWA data. FHD does foreground subtraction by \emph{forward modeling}, which builds a simulated data set, including instrumental effects, and subtracts it from the actual data. This forward modeling feature can also be used as a standalong simulation tool, to generate raw visibilities of foregrounds, noise, and EoR off of existing and future 21cm experiments.

%------------------------------------------------

\section*{Calibration}

The most common techniques we use on visibility calibration are redundant calibration and sky model based calibration. Sky model calibration requires some preknowledges about the sky. With some assumptions about source structures about the sky and understanding of our instrument, we use FHD (Fast Holographic Deconvolution) to calibrate visibility data. The algorithm FHD uses is basically 'CLEAN' algorithm. Redundant calibration is sky model independent. All it assumes is that same antenna separations should measure exact the same Fourier mode of the sky. Redundant calibration requires antenna array with good redundant calibratability, like PAPER64 (The Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization), MWA (Murchison WideField Array) PhaseII hexes, HERA (Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array).
