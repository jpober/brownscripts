\section*{Introduction}
Following the recombination of hydrogen and release of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the baryonic matter of the universe consisted mostly of neutral hydrogen and helium. Gradually, small inhomogeneities collapsed and ignited into the first luminous structures. Energetic photons emitted from the first stars and quasars reionized the surrounding medium, producing ionized bubbles which grew and merged into the fully ionized intergalactic medium we see today. This \emph{Epoch of Reionization} (EoR) remains a poorly-understood period of the universe's history which offers a wealth of cosmological and astrophysical information.

The Pober lab is part of an international effort to build instruments capable of studying the EoR. The neutral hydrogen (HI) of the EoR emits faintly at a wavelength of 21cm due to the hyperfine transition. This emission is unique to neutral hydrogen, and is anti-correlated with the ionized (HII) regions that fill the universe through the EoR. CMB constraints and quasar absorption spectra place the EoR within the redshift range $6 < z < 12$, which means 21cm emissions will reach us at meter scale wavelengths. This is accessible to modern radio interferometers, including the \emph{Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization} (PAPER), the \emph{Murchison Widefield Array} (MWA), and our newly observing \emph{Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array} (HERA). Extracting this weak signal remains a challenge unprecedented in radio astronomy.

The differential brightness temperature $\delta T_b$ is the contrast between the intensity of 21 cm emissions/absorptions against the Cosmic Microwave Background. Its full expression is related to cosmological (green) and astrophysical (red) parameters.

\section*{The Foreground Problem} %[I dont need all of these plots, they're just there to be cut as needed or if necessary to take up more space]
%Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds pose a difficult problem when trying to measure the 21cm EoR signal. Relative to galactic foregrounds, the EoR signal is $\sim$ 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the galactic emissions that exist between our observing radio telescope arrays and the highly redshifted 21cm signal. The overlapping sources of power in our observations can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:foregroundsrcs}.  -- Just making this shorter, and clarifying a bit on what the foregrounds are.

The expected EoR signal is $\sim$ 5 orders of magnitude weaker than known foreground sources, such as diffuse emission from the Galaxy and extragalactic point sources. Removing these foregrounds, as well as instrumental noise, is a nontrivial problem. An example of the overlapping sources of power in our observations can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:foregroundsrcs}. In addition to galactic and extragalactic foregrounds we must also contend with Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).

%\end{figure}



\subsection*{Deep Learning for RFI Mitigation}
RFI is present in all radio observations and consists of both terrestrial (e.g. TV stations) and in orbit (e.g. satellites) sources. This interference reduces sensitivity in 21cm EoR experiments because it can be present in nearly all frequency channels and is brighter than galactic foregrounds. Due to the nature of how RFI manifests itself in visibility data as sharp discontinuities or disruptive amorphous shapes, novel machine learning techniques can be applied. We introduce a Deep Fully Convolutional Neural Network (D-FCN) which uses the time-frequency context from both amplitude and phase to form a robust and efficient method for identifying RFI.

\frame{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/PostFCStitchArch_v6_1.png}}
\caption{Deep Full Convolutional Neural Network (D-FCN) architecture design for application to interferometric visibilities. The input space consists of a normalized log amplitude (upper branch) and it's corresponding phase component. Both input layers reintroduce coarse time-frequency information into the transpose convolutional layers in what's referred to as `skip connections'.}
\label{fig:DFCNArch}
\end{figure}
%To overcome foreground dominance in our power spectrum analysis we can use a combination of foreground power mitigating techniques as outlined in the following sections.
%The issue of foreground emission dominance in our power spectrum can be overcome through the mixed use of the following traditional and novel foreground mitigation techniques. \\
%\subsubsection*{Foreground Subtraction}
%Foreground subtraction is performed in the image domain using an extragalactic source catalog. The source catalog is used to generate a foreground model which can then be fit by an $n^{th}$ order polynomial and subtracted from the observation.
%Baseline visibilities are gridded to form an image which is calibrated to a catalog model. The catalog model contains point sources from 
%surveys which contain the sources' right ascension, declination, and flux in stokes I. The model built from the catalog of sources is 
%additionally convolved with the telescope arrays synthesized beam model. The resulting model which has been built can then be subtracted 
%from the observation leaving behind the EoR signal and diffuse emissions.

%\subsection*{Hydrid Foreground Subtraction and Avoidance}
%The need for managing foregrounds in 21cm EoR experiments has led to two distinct techniques: Avoidance and Subtraction. Avoidance is the practice of filtering out foregrounds in Fourier space. Subtraction requires a model of either extragalactic point sources or diffuse emission that can be precisely subtracted from observations. The hybrid approach attempts to use both techniques to further mitigate foreground contamination for the purpose of an EoR detection in the 21cm power spectrum.

%\centering
%\frame{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/DIFFXMid.png}}
%\caption{The differenced power spectrum of filtering (blue) and filtering + subtraction (purple) from Fig. \ref{fig:stages}. This demonstrates that the hybrid foreground subtraction and avoidance technique is able to remove additional contamination from foregrounds necessary for placing the tightest constraints on the EoR power spectrum.}

%\end{figure}

%\subsubsection*{Foreground Avoidance}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{delaytransform}
%V_b(\tau) = \int dl dm d\nu A(l,m,\nu)I(l,m,\nu)e^{-2\pi i\nu(\tau_g -\tau)}
%\end{equation}
%Equation \ref{delaytransform} demonstrates the delay transform used to transform a visibility to delay space. By working in delay space it can be seen in both Figs. \ref{foregroundsrcs1} \& \ref{foregroundsrcs2} that power from foreground sources are confined within a delay limit known as the horizon limit. --- this seemed unclear, so I made it a little longe

%Equation \ref{delaytransform} demonstrates the \emph{delay transform}: A Fourier transform of frequency to its conjugate \emph{delay}. There is a natural limit in delay, set by the time it takes light from a source at the horizon to travel between the two antennas of a baseline. Power from foreground sources is confined within this \emph{horizon limit}, as shown by Figs. \ref{foregroundsrcs1} \& \ref{foregroundsrcs2}.

%Taking the Fourier transform of a baseline visibility over frequency with the geometric group delay offset (eqn. \ref{delaytransform}) results %in smooth spectrum foregrounds bunching up nearest to the delay of $\tau = 0$. This is because foreground sources have a maximal %geometric delay associated with a baseline length, $|\vec{b}|$, which is also known as the horizon limit. The EoR signal is unsmooth %spectrally, distinguishing it from foreground sources, and pushing it beyond the horizon limit imposed by the baseline length. Using this %information, delays below the horizon limit can be filtered giving significant foreground power removal.

Smooth spectral sources moving between delays over time can be seen to remain within the horizon limit (dotted), while unsmooth spectral sources (light blue) extend beyond the horizon limit.  \textbf{Source}: Aaron Parsons, \textit{A Per Baseline Delay-Spectrum Technique for Accessing the 21cm Cosmic Reionization Signature, Apj. 2012}}

\section*{Simulation}

The particular characteristics of an array can introduce unexpected effects into the data. Understanding and mitigating instrumental effects is critical to making a confident detection of the EoR. For this reason, much effort has been put into simulating the full analysis pipeline -- from the point and diffuse sources on the sky, to the raw visibilities that come out of the correlator, to the power spectrum estimations.

Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD) is a purpose-built software framework for analyzing MWA data. FHD does foreground subtraction by \emph{forward modeling}, which builds a simulated data set, including instrumental effects, and subtracts it from the actual data. This forward modeling feature can also be used as a standalone simulation tool, to generate raw visibilities of foregrounds, noise, and EoR off of existing and future 21cm experiments.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.9]{figures/sim_flowchart.png}
\caption{A sample data file (or generated data file) holds array coordinates over time and the frequency channels of the instrument. Given a beam model for the antenna, FHD calculates the full synthesized beam (or point-spread function) for a particular time and set of frequencies. The synthesized beam can then convert a sky catalog into a set of foreground visibilities for the instrument. External EoR simulations can also be fed in to test EoR sensitivity, or Gaussian noise can be injected to simulate noise.}
\end{figure}

%------------------------------------------------
\section*{Calibration}

%The most common techniques we use on visibility calibration are redundant calibration and sky model based calibration. Sky model calibration requires some preknowledge about the sky. With our assumptions about source structures of the sky and understanding of our instrument, we use FHD (Fast Holographic Deconvolution) to calibrate visibility data. The algorithm FHD uses is basically 'CLEAN' algorithm. Redundant calibration is sky model independent. All it assumes is that same antenna separations should measure exact the same Fourier mode of the sky. Redundant calibration requires antenna array with good redundant calibratability, like PAPER64, MWA PhaseII hexes and HERA.  -- [I cut the (Fast Holographic Deconvolution) since I gave the acronym earlier.]

Interferometric arrays seeking to measure the 21 cm signal from the EoR must contend with overwhelmingly bright emission from foreground sources. Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in recent years. Current calibration efforts for EoR observations largely fall into two camps:  sky-based calibration using deep foreground catalogs and forward modeling of the instrument visibilities, and redundant calibration that foregoes a sky model but requires the antennas be placed on a regular grid. A further exploration of combining both approaches has been pushing on to mitigate the contamination in the power spectrum.

\section*{Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)}

The Murchison Widefield Array is one of the three Square Kilometer Array (SKA) Precursor telescopes located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia, hunting for the intergalactic hydrogen gas during the Epoch of Reionization. It is a low frequency telescope operating at 80-300MHz, with a processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz. The Phase I of MWA consists of 128 tiles pseudo-randomly distributed over 3 km diameter area. The newly upgraded Phase II of the MWA has the additional 128 tiles installed, with 72 of them forming into two hexagonal cores.

It has since been partially reconfigured into Phase II, which includes two hexagonal grids of tiles designed for high-redundancy EoR research. MWA is a pathfinder project for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).}
%\end{figure}
The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array is a $2^{nd}$ generation radio interferometer observing the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization. HERA will eventually be an array with 350 14-meter parabolic dishes in South Africa. These elements will be divided into a 320-element hexagonal shaped core and 30 outriggers. The current stage of HERA has 37 dishes deployed and observing. 

%Although increasingly stringent upper limits of the 21 cm signal have been placed by the first generation experiments targeting the EoR such as the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization array (PAPER), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), they are not able to detect it due to their sensitivity limits (see Fig. \ref{fig:HERAsense}). HERA is designed to bring both the sensitivity and precision required to directly constrain the topology and evolution of reionization. By understanding the evolution of reionization we can better comprehend the formation of the first stars and earliest galaxies.\\
